        <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>While most of my experience has been centered in the hospitality business, it has given me some amazing skills that apply to web development as well. While the more specific skills do not transfer over, the core skills however do greatly.</p>
          <p>In kitchens the greatest asset is the team, if one person on the team is slower or not as skilled it hampers and hurts the entire operation. This forces you to learn how to cope with the weaknesses of your team members, while also teaching you how to help improve them both for their benefit and yours.</p>
          <p>There is great saying regarding <cite>Murphy's Law</cite> that applies to daily life in kitchens that prepares you for the rest of the world: <q>If there is a wrong way to do something, then someone will do it.</q> Leading you to always prepare for the worst case scenarios, to try and get ahead of them. It also helps with pre planning with problems you anticipate, so you can solve them rapidly.</p>
          <p>While it is a big change in terms of career choices I strongly believe the core skills I’ve learned will be a great boon once transferred. As well it is never too late, as quoted from one of my favorites from the hospitality industry the late Anthony Bourdain <q>I should’ve died in my 20s. I became successful in my 40s. I became a dad in my 50s.</q></p>
